<p>A great multitude of objects orbit the Sun. Among the much larger planets and moons, there are also small Solar System
bodies: asteroids, comets and meteoroids. Most asteroids orbit in the Asteroid Belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter and
many comets reside in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune's orbit.</p>

    <p>Not all such objects are found in those regions of the Solar System, however. Comets are known to have highly elliptical orbits that take them close to the Sun and then extremely far away,
        growing long, wispy tails in the process. Likewise, there are asteroids found within the orbit of Mars whose orbits take them
        close to Earth. Such small bodies are referred to as Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).</p>

        NEOs have orbits take them within about 1.3 AU from the Sun at perihelion. The sizes of these objects vary between a few meters to over a tens of kilometers in diameter.
        About 16,000 NEOs have been discovered so far. Most of these objects don't pose a huge threat to life on Earth as their size and
        proximity to our planet is not cause for concern. Within this NEO classification lies another group of objects: Potentially
        Hazardous Objects (PHOs).

        These objects have the potential to get close to Earth and cause widespread devastation should they
        impact our planet. PHOs range in size from 0.1 to 7 km in diameter and get as close as 0.05 AU from Earth. Over 1,700 PHOs are
        known to exist. Though the chances of being hit by an asteroid or any other space object are miniscule (1 in 1.6 million), keeping
        track of these objects is vital to ensure safety for our planet.
